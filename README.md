# Retail-Data-Analysis

In this project, you will go through a real-world use case from the retail sector.
Your task would be to ingest data from a centralised Kafka server in real-time and process it to calculate various KPIs or key performance indicators.

Broadly, you will perform the following tasks in this project:

1. Reading the sales data from the Kafka server

2. Preprocessing the data to calculate additional derived columns such as total_cost etc

3. Calculating the time-based KPIs and time and country-based KPIs

4. Storing the KPIs (both time-based and time- and country-based) for a 10-minute interval into separate JSON files for further analysis
